# My personal blog

I work on the `develop` branch.

Hugo builds on Travis are set to the `master` branch.

New post commit format:

```
post: post-file-name.md

e.g. new post: my-first-post.md
```

Updating a blog post:

```
update post: post-file-name.md

e.g. update post: my-first-post.md
```

Setting up a new theme commit:

```
theme: Update to <insert-theme-name-here>

e.g. theme: Update to temple
```

Commit something that will be rebased:

```
[Rebase] <description-here>
```
