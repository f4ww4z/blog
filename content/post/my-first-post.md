A guy sat in a wooden chair agetatedly, with his red frowning eyes staring at the live computer screen. His mind raced with doubts of being able to create his very own customizable open blog site. Countless WordPress sites had he seen with custom domains and their rich theme adaptation and what not. Struggling upon Google searches, he had found yet no solution...

##### and then he found GitHub. And this open source website building framework called Hugo.

And today is when he starts his personalized blog, with the spirit of an open source tools and environment.


```java
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
	}
```
