## Who's at the door

Hey there. I guess you already know my name. But *who* is it?

I am an open source enthusiast and a self-teaching Android developer, publishing my apps to the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=164+Boys+Group) when I have free time. 

> *"When I have free time."*

Being a high school student sucks sometimes, when I am given too many assignments that are not tailed to one student's future plans. In my opinion stacks of redundant assignemnts like these are a waste of time, both for the students and also for teachers assessing these tasks. *Because who knows when you stumble upon Quantum Physics during your app development*.

I also actively contribute to the **[Open Medical Record System](http://openmrs.org)**, an open source Health IT by and for the entire planet, starting with the developing world.

## 2016 - now

I will start by conversing my short history of my involvement with OpenMRS, Google Code-in and open source projects in general.

My history of getting involved in the world of open source was back in late 2016, upon stumbling on an online competition. [BesutKode](http://besutkode.org/), the name of the competition, is a beginner friendly code developing competition designed to get students to really grasp the idea of an open source community.

Friends who took part in BesutKode and I studied our first [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (VCS), **git**. We were asked to create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/), the place where our journey through open source began.
